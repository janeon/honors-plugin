"49328260","49328260","26","4","<p>In a lot of examples of memoization, I see it most commonly that people favor making a wrapper or decorator (or some language-dependent variation of this, such as using a higher-order function to close over a memo object) to store the results of previous function calls in an almost 'state-like' fashion.  Such an example can be seen below: </p>

        return 1
    if (n in memo):

"59142319","59142319","19","3","<p>I hope that together we can solve my problem, I will try to summarise it and paste in some codes. 
At our research we are using TensorFlow/Keras for our DNN, to classify images (convolutional network). It was a quite simple Sequential model, but now we are trying to add more inputs, so I started to change the network to the Functional API (honestly, this is the first time that I used it). I recreated the original convolutional network and everything was working fine. 
So I generated the necessary additional data into simple text files (one for each image) and these will be the second input in our model. This is were something went wrong, because I've got an error and now I am stuck with the solution.</p>

<p>To recreate the error, I made a new simple python file without the convolution part, just to try out the model's text file part. The input is 5000 text files, containing only a float number. After the preprocessing, we will have 4000 for train and additional 1000 for testing, both are stored in a numpy array. The train and test arrays were split through <em>sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split</em>.</p>

<p>In the original multi-channel network, I tried to concatenate the convolutional part with the text file and after it some dense layers are coming. But no concatenate here, just the train for the data stored in the text files.</p>

<p>Here are the shapes of the input and label arrays:<br>
X_train.shape<br>
(4000,)<br>
y_train.shape<br>
(4000, 5)<br></p>

<p>The - very - simple network:</p>

<pre><code>inputA = Input(shape=(X_train.shape[0],))
x = Flatten()(inputA)
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(64, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dense(5, activation='softmax')(x)
x = Model(inputs=inputA, outputs = x)
</code></pre>

<p>Compile:</p>

<pre><code>x.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy', optimizer='sgd', metrics=['accuracy'])
</code></pre>

<p>Model fit:</p>

<pre><code>x.fit(X_train, y_train, 
          validation_data=(X_test, y_test),
          batch_size=batch, 
          verbose=1, 
          epochs=epoch_number)
</code></pre>

<p>And the received error message:</p>

<pre><code>ValueError: Error when checking input: expected input_8 to have shape (4000,) but got array with shape (1,)
</code></pre>

<p>The question is, what did I wrong? The previous codes are working just fine in the Sequential model, but here no. Could somebody help me solve this mystery?</p>

"58284339","58284339","55","8","<p>Say I have a class with some members, and the members have a less restrictive access modifier than the class itself.</p>

<p>A concrete example could be:</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>package apples;

class A { // package private
    public int foo() { // public (=&gt; less restrictive than *package private*)
        return 42;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To my understanding a <strong><em>class</strong> access modifier</em> that is more restrictive than the <strong><em>member</strong> access modifier</em>, will override the less restrictive <strong><em>member</strong> access modifiers</em>. So a less restrictive <strong><em>member</strong> access modifier</em> should have no effect at all.</p>

<ul>
<li>Is my understanding correct?

<ul>
<li>If not, what are the consequences?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What could be valid reasons to have less restrictive member access modifiers?</li>
<li>Finally, what are there <em>best practice</em> to follow?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I also did some experimenting because I thought it might have consequences once I start passing function references around, however even then the access modifier does not seem to matter.</p>

<p>The situation that I constructed is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apples.B</code> provides a public method <code>bla()</code> that returns a reference to <code>apples.A.foo</code>.</li>
<li>Then <code>pizzas.C</code> calls <code>apples.B.bla</code> to obtain a reference to <code>A.foo</code> and calls it.</li>
<li>So <code>A.foo()</code> is not directly visible to <code>C</code>, but is only indirectly accessible via <code>B.bla()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>I tested it and it does not make a difference whether I make the access modifier of <code>foo()</code> <em>package private</em> or not.</p>

<pre class=""lang-java prettyprint-override""><code>package apples;

import java.util.function.IntSupplier;

public class B {
    public IntSupplier getReferenceToAFoo() {
        A aInstance = new A();
        return aInstance::foo;
    }
}

        return intsupplier.getAsInt();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        C cInstance = new C();

        int i = cInstance.callAFooIndirectly();

<p>So, I would like to create a regex query, made up of three parts:</p>

<pre><code>1) [ABCD]

2) (CD)+|(DC)+

3) [BADC]
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that this query will of course match any of ABCD at the beginning and end. What I would like is for the beginning and end to be related, so that if it only matches if the substring begins with A and ends with B, begins with B and ends with A etc (as in the ordering in the [] above).</p>

<p>I.e., I do not want to match ACDCDA, but I do want to match ACDCDB.</p>

<p>I know this is possible by stringing together four queries of the form:</p>

<pre><code>([A](CD)+|(DC)+[B])|([B](CD)+|(DC)+[A]) etc
</code></pre>

<p>but this quickly becomes ugly and hard to read. Is there a more elegant way to do this with regular expressions? </p>

<p>Edit: to answer questions in comments:
Language is python, although ideally I'm looking for a general regex expression so that this can work elsewhere if necessary.</p>

<p>Additional examples:</p>

<p>Acceptable:</p>

<p>CCDD</p>

<p>DCDC</p>

"57718708","57718708","14","2","<p>I have a JPA 2.1 application that connects to two different databases with two different sets of tables. Within IntelliJ, there is a Persistence View you can use to assign each JPA Entity to the appropriate Data Source and this works fine. IntelliJ is able to validate the Entity's Table and Column against the corresponding table in the Data Source.</p>

<p>Every now and then, IntelliJ (version 2018.3) loses my choice and attaches the Entity to the other Data Source. I find this out when I open the class and find the Entity's table and columns don't match. I stumble across the change some indefinite time after the swap has occurred.</p>

<p>My work-around is to manually remove the incorrect assignment and make the correct assignment. IntelliJ's inability to remember this assignment is getting old.</p>

<p>I suspect IntelliJ might be auto-generating files to represent the classes which are annotated @Entity and maybe this is where the problem lies.</p>

<p>I understand I could add the Entity to the persistence.xml using the <code>&lt;class&gt;</code> attribute such that the data source assignment is made in this config file, but it only appears to be a problem with IntelliJ. Deployments (maven-based) to the server compile and run as expected.</p>

<p>Is there something I can do with IntelliJ to avoid losing the data source assignments?</p>

To address this, I'd like to store the build definition alongside the code, so that it executes the build as it looked at the time the hotfix is branched from.</p>

<p>I've been looking into exporting the TC build definitions as Kotlin scripts, but I have a couple of issues with them:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Versioned Settings</code> is controlled by a higher-level project I don't have access to, and is stored in a separate repository (and not as Kotlin).</li>
<li>It seems like it'll just look at your master branch and import settings from there, but I need the build to use whatever is on my hotfix branch at the point of execution.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past, we've solved this with Fake scripts, but the experience tends not to be very good for identifying problems.</p>

<p>What's the best way to execute builds on TeamCity to meet the following requirements?</p>

<li>Build defined within the branch/code under execution</li>

<blockquote>
  <p>Update: For the interested reader, here is some background information
  on my original problem. The above examples are just minimum working
  samples to illustrate the main issue (which indeed feature dead end if
  statements). In practice, I was trying to make a function useable for
  colleagues who did not have certain library/toolbox functions
  available, by overwriting those functions for simplified custom ones
  if they did not exist, as a quick fix. In particular, it concerned
  imdilate (and imerode). The function looked something like the
  following:</p>

<pre><code>function [myoutputs] = myfunction(myinputs)

% if the images toolbox is not available, use the following simplified
% replacement function
if ~exist('imdilate','file')
    imdilate = @(IM,SE)vecdilate(IM,SE);
end

%% The original function goes here, which uses a lot of imdilate(IM,SE).

%% local functions
function M = vecdilate(IM,SE)
% simplified version of imdilate (can only process 1-D vertical arrays)

nSE = size(SE);
nIM = size(IM);
SE = logical(SE); % make logical if it isn't yet

% copy and shift xth column x down. new border entries are 0:
M = repmat([IM;zeros(nSE)],nSE);
M = M(1:end-nSE(1));
M = reshape(M,[size(M,1)/nSE(1) nSE(1)]);

% shrink back to column by taking max of every row:
M = max(M(:,SE),[],2);
M = M(ceil(nSE(1)/2)-1+(1:nIM(1))); % clip to obtain correct size
</code></pre>
  
  <p>You might see that the replacement function covers some
  functionality of imdilate, but not all, and it might not be as
  efficient. The purpose simply was to use function A if it was available, and
  function B if it was not. To my surprise however, the former case
  returned an error, which eventually resulted in this question. For your interest, I solved the practical problem by renaming the function in the
  original code, and by using an if/else statement:</p>

<pre><code>function [myoutputs] = myfunction(myinputs)

% if the images toolbox is not available, use the following simplified
% replacement function
if ~exist('imdilate','file')
    mydilate = @(IM,SE)vecdilate(IM,SE);
else
    mydilate = @(IM,SE)imdilate(IM,SE);
end

%% The original function goes here, which uses a lot of mydilate(IM,SE).

%% local functions
function M = vecdilate(IM,SE)
etc. etc. etc.

<p>In which the event column defines whether or not an event in a column occurs (True) or not (False). And the countdown column identifies the number of subsequent rows/steps that have to occur until said event occurs. I have tried the following:</p>

<pre><code>y['block'] = (y['event'] != y['event'].shift(1)).astype(int).cumsum()
y['countdown'] = y.groupby('block').transform(lambda x: range(1, len(x) + 1))

<p>but it seems grossly inefficient for the operation and doesn't necessarily perform the operation as described, identifying periods as groups instead of a simple rollout. </p>

<p>As I mentioned the idea is that for each one of my variables I would like to fill NAs with the last observation carried forward. But I would want only to retain the highest value. For instance <code>otherVar</code> in 1970 was 1.3 so this value was carried forward to 1980 to fill NA. In 1990 the value of <code>otherVar</code> is 3.5, so it ""takes the place"" of 1.3 and the score of <code>otherVar</code> in 1990 is 3.5. Finally, in 2000 the score of <code>otherVar</code> is 1.5. since 1.5&lt; 3.5, in the final dataset the higher value is carried forward.</p>

<p>I would like to find the least computationally-intensive method to do this since I have to do it for thousands of variables.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot in advance for your help</p>

"33268177","33268177","94","14","<p>I have a function <code>(*~)</code>. Most of the cost of evaluating <code>x *~ y</code> comes from inspecting the second argument, roughly along these lines:</p>

<pre><code>(*~) :: a -&gt; b d -&gt; c d a

           Bar -&gt; cheapFunction y' x

<p>Is there some way to convince GHC to partially evaluate operator sections like <code>(*~ y)</code>?</p>

<p>I tried rewriting it like:</p>

<pre><code>(*~) = flip go
  where
    go y = let y' = expensive y
            in case y' of
                 Bar -&gt; cheapFunction y'

<p>but it didn't seem to help. I think this might be because <code>flip</code> requires all it's arguments before it does the flipping?</p>

<p>One way would just be to flip the operator itself, but it reads much more naturally when the expensive operand is on the right hand side, because it lines up with an existing notation.</p>

<p>Can a properly crafted <code>{-# RULE #-}</code> bail me out here? If so, what should it say? (I'm unclear on how far the sectioning syntax will have been desugared before rules look for matches, among other things.)</p>

A1 is a number corresponding to a drawing, B1 is the dimension on the drawing, C1 is the actual dimension we encountered, D1 is the manufacturing error tolerance which is something like ±.005 or ± 1°. They vary between a few numbers on each drawing, and the drawings vary. E1 is a column that needs to say either Accept or Reject, reject is when the B1 dimension is more than the D1 away from the C1 value. </p>

<p>I inherited the spreadsheet with the function =IF(AND(C1&lt;=(B1+.005), C1>=(B1-.005)), ""Accept"", ""Reject""). This works, but I need to keep changing the .005 to values like .020 and 1° and I want to finish this faster than doing it all by hand. I would like to be able to drag in down the whole E column and have it fill out accept and reject accordingly.</p>

<p>I tried changing it (C1&lt;=(B1+D1)) so it pulls from the tolerance, but get a value error because every tolerance has a ± in front of it. I tried adding MID to it, but I keep getting errors because I'm not quite sure how to incorporate it.</p>

<p>I couldn't find other help online because most people using MID are trying to extract characters, but I need the tolerances to stay the same in the D column.

<p>Fragment container will be replaced with fragments when nav bar items are clicked. The issue is that in one of the fragment I have a recyclerview. The onBindView of all the items in the recyclerview is getting invoked all at once. I need to avoid this mainly because I am trying to implement Pagination like this:</p>

<pre><code>override fun onBindViewHolder(holder: TopUpViewHolder, position: Int) {
    val item = myDataset[position]
    holder.bind(item)
    if (position == this.itemCount - 1){
        // do your load more task here
        viewModel.fetchTopUpData()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>(I tried attaching scroll listener and implement pagination like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36127734/detect-when-recyclerview-reaches-the-bottom-most-position-while-scrolling"">this</a>. But the canScrollVertically(1) is getting invoked even when the user has not reached the end, probably because of nestedscrollview itself.)</p>

<p>I'm struggling to come up with how I can sort the file globbing.  I'm hoping to avoid a task for set_fact in a loop to create an array, another task to sort, and another task to include the files.  Is there a more efficient way that I'm missing?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Thanks to Zeitounator I have a final working code of:</strong></p>

<pre><code>- hosts: localhost

<p>Btw after copy-and-pasting the code into a brand new project, only changing the test function's name to <code>Main</code>, the results are reversed. Every time I run that project, <code>Test2</code> is faster.</p>

<p><strong>So what are the factors involved in making this slower and faster?</strong>
And: <strong>Can I influence performance deliberately in .net to my benefit?</strong></p>

<p>These methods of course are doing almost nothing, so a 10% performance difference for a test that involves mainly identical virtual method calls (which, afaik the CLR is not capable of inlining - chapeau to Sun btw for implementing that in the JVM) seems huge.</p>

<p>N.B. This is in fact a minimal version of a real program, where multiple nested switch statements result in a huge performance difference of not just 10%, but 100% and more, apparently by the mere existence of code inside the nested switch branches which the tests never enter. (So maybe this minimal version omits some other aspects of the real program that might be involved, but it does replicate a significant and consistent performance difference)</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong> In the real program, what may matter more than the phenomenon in this question, is whether the actual case statements in the switch statement lend themselves to implementation via <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table"" rel=""noreferrer"">branch table</a> or not - (which depends on the gaps in the case values - something I could verify this by looking at the generated IL code)</p>

&lt;/body&gt;

</code></pre>

<p><strong>What am I trying to do?</strong>
My code is supposed to take the string entered into the html textfield (which is actually supposed to be a barcode/serial number). And search for the item with that serial number in a database and return the item name into a HTML option listbox. I'm 100% sure the correct data is returned. I'm just having issues with calling the javascript function to add the data to the listbox.</p>

<p><strong>My code structure:</strong>
As soon as the enter button is clicked, and the post data is set:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""input-group""&gt;
        &lt;label&gt;Scan Barcode:&lt;/label&gt;
        &lt;input type=""text"" id=""barcode"" name=""barcode""&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=""input-group""&gt;
        &lt;button class=""btn"" name=""insert"" &gt;Enter&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I used php to fetch the item name using the entered data. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_POST['insert'])) 
{
    $barcode = mysqli_real_escape_string($db, $_POST['barcode']);

    $query = ""SELECT * FROM item_info WHERE serial_no = '$barcode'"";
    $results = mysqli_query($db, $query);

    if (mysqli_num_rows($results) == 1)
    {
        $row = mysqli_fetch_array($results);
        $itemname = $row[1];

        ?&gt;
        &lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
            var value = ""&lt;?php echo $itemname; ?&gt;"";
            insertValue(value);
        &lt;/script&gt;
        &lt;?php
    }
    else
    {
        array_push($errors, ""Unable to find an item with that Serial Number"");
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see where I called the javascript function above, like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type=""text/javascript""&gt;
        var value = ""&lt;?php echo $itemname; ?&gt;"";
        insertValue(value);
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>My actual javascript function is structured like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;

    function insertValue(itemname)
    { 
        var x = document.getElementById(""myselect"");
        var option = document.createElement(""option"");
        option.text = itemname;


        if(option.text.length == 0)
        {   
            //Do Nothing.
        }
        else
        {
            option.className = ('option');
            x.size = ""8"";
            x.add(option);
            document.getElementById(""barcode"").value = """";
        }
    }

    function deleteValue()
    {
        var x = document.getElementById(""myselect"");
        x.size = ""8"";
        x.remove(x.selectedIndex);
    }

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So my problem is:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The data is entered in the textfield, the correct item name is returned from the database, but for some unknown reason is unable to be shown in the option list box.</p></li>
<li><p>I don't even know where to include ""return false;"" Doesn't seem to work anywhere either.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Please help. Thanks.</p>

<p>HTML has a well understood <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element with an <code>action</code> and a <code>method</code>. But if I'm posting to a resource location and I want to defend against concurrent updates the client will need to supply an If-Match.</p>

<p>It's not a given that the URL to which I'm posting can be retrieved with a GET or HEAD and therefore the client cannot get hold of the latest ETag.</p>

<p>I've noticed that neither HTML nor JSON Ion hypertext media-types, have support for an <code>ifmatch</code> or <code>etag</code> on the form.</p>

<p>It would negate the need for the client to try and then fail and then GET and then try again, or to GET another resource first or know and remember to keep hold of an ETag from another location.</p>

<p>Not sure if this an oversight or am I insane to be posting to resource locations that cannot be viewed.</p>

<p>The problem with posting to a viewable URL is the obvious extra code just really to support this situation.</p>

<p>And then if posting to a URL that exists and has some other utility, allows other stuff to be posted, then the ""shape"" of the incoming data must be distinguished in order to route to the correct handling code.</p>

<p>Seems like the whole thing would be much simpler with a prepopulated <code>ifmatch</code> in the form.</p>

<p>So, the question:</p>

<p>Should I design my hypermedia control (form) to have a prepopulated <code>ifmatch</code> element?</p>

<p>What I would like to do is <code>df['cat'].map({'A\d': 'a', 'B1': 'b'})</code>, but <code>A\d</code> seems not be interpreted as a regex. In this simple MWE I could do <code>df['cat'].map({'A1': 'a', 'A2': 'a', 'B1': 'b'})</code>, but in the real world, the regex is much more complicated. Also the dictionary is much more complicated, so that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46162202/pandas-series-replace-using-dictionary-with-regex-keys"">the solution here</a> (which requires to add start and end statementents and apply <code>re.compile</code> around the keys) is not feasable.</p>

I.e. I have something like</p>

<pre><code>myUpdate :: Update MyState ()
myUpdate = &lt;some outdated implementation&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, obviously I can't just change the implementation haphazardly as it would corrupt my transaction history, so I was wondering how people usually handle this. The way I see it my options are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stop the server. Run <code>createCheckpoint</code> for my <code>AcidState</code>. Update the <code>Event</code> implementation and then restart the server. Since we load from a fresh snapshot, the changed <code>Update</code> should never trigger for the old events.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a a new <code>Update</code> with a new name (like <code>myUpdate_v2</code>) and update my server logic to only use <code>myUpdate_v2</code> everywhere instead of the original <code>myUpdate</code>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I think both options have their merits. (1) is nicer since I don't need to retain the old functionality in my codebase but it has to be done very carefully for each server I update or I risk corrupting data. (2) is safer (especially if I remove the old <code>myUpdate</code> from my module's exports so I can be sure I don't accidentally use the old implementation anywhere), but it feels a bit ugly otherwise.</p>

<p>Is there some better way of doing this? I see this as something I will definitely encounter every then and again in a long-lived project so I would like to have a good, standard workflow for applying changes to the implementation of my events.</p>

<p>So I am rebuilding an exisiting application that dealt with a rather large amount of bureaucracy, and needs to keep track of five separate dates (as shown in the histories table). The problem that I am having is that I don't know how best to model this in ActiveRecord, historically it's been done by having the histories tables represented as so:</p>

<pre><code>histories
  initial_date
  updated_date
  r_doc_date
  l_doc_date
  datasheet_finalized_date
  username
</code></pre>

<p>Where only one of the five date fields could ever be filled at one time...which in my opinion is a terrible way to go about modeling this...</p>

<p>So basically I want to build a unique queryable connection between every date in the histories table and its specific relevant user. Is it possible to use every timestamp in the histories table as a foreign key to query the specific user?</p>

<p>When you CMD + click the UpdateProfileMutation you are directed to the mutations file where UpdateProfileMutation is exported from. It is a valuable feature. But the problem is that the current file where the above code resides is closed when the new file opens. This is a problematic behaviour because you often want to quickly look in a file and then go back to the file it is imported to. So my question is: can you force CMD + click to open a new tab with the file? Or is there a keyboard shortcut for going back from the file you have just clicked?</p>

<p>Since the files containing the unit tests are spread across the entire folder structure of the package, I use the test discovery mode to execute the unit tests:</p>

<pre class=""lang-bash prettyprint-override""><code>python -m unittest discover \
       --pattern ""*_test.py"" \
       --start-directory ""path/to/package/root""
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, this results in a messed up text stream on the console because both log messages and output from the unit test runner are forwarded to <code>stdout</code>. </p>

<p>For single test modules (which I store in separate files <code>&lt;module_name&gt;_test.py</code>), I usually control the logging output globally within the <code>__main__</code>-block:</p>

<pre><code># In &lt;module_name&gt;_test.py

import logging
import unittest
# ...

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    # Forward log messages into a file test.log.
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG,

    unittest.main()
</code></pre>

<p>When executing <code>python &lt;module_name&gt;_test.py</code>, this ensures that the log messages are separated from the unit test output.</p>

<p>However, in test discovery mode, the <code>__main__</code>-blocks of my test-modules are never executed. Therefore my question is: How to globally set up logging in test discovery mode? Ideally, I would have to configure the logger only in a single place, and not in all test modules separately. Is this possible?</p>

<p>However, I’d want to optimise the script such that it looks up &amp; sets value based on the header name instead of someone hard coding the values because it becomes difficult every time a new column is introduced in between the existing array of dataset.</p>

<p>Main data table is for a website CMS.
So, there's the PAGE it's on, the SECTION of the page it shows up on, and the CONTENT (text, html, etc)</p>

<p>I then have two tables, one having all the available PAGE names on the site, and one with all the possible SECTION names. (used to populate the menus)</p>

<p>In the CMS data New Entry page, I want the user to be able to select from drop-down menus the PAGE they want first, and (here's the tricky part) then populate the second drop-down menu with ONLY the page sections that don't already have data. (So they can't create a second ""Index Page Main Content"" record, for example).</p>

<p>I've found plenty of solutions using all manner of things to dynamically fill the second menu - but no clue how to create a query that polls the main db based on the page chosen from the first menu and looks to see what sections types are still unused. </p>

<li><p><code>CHRDEV_MAJOR_DYN_EXT_END = 384</code></p></li>

<p>In the first part, the function iterates through all major numbers between 254 and 234. The verified array positions are from 254 to 234. In the second part, the function iterates through all major numbers between 511 and 384. The function <code>major_to_index(i)</code> just returns i % 255, so the second function verifies array positions from 511 % 255, i.e. 1, to 384 % 255, i.e. 129. My question is, why are the positions between 130 and 233 not verified? Before this function was introduced, in order to find a free major number, all major numbers between 0 and 255 were verified. Why this was changed?</p>

<p>My question is if there is any alternative that I could use. Or has a feature like this been intentionally removed? I am using jquery-3.2.1.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any helping thoughts.</p>

How can I change that back to blue? Anywhere I can reset it? I looked in <code>Seetings&gt;Editor&gt;Color Scheme</code>, but couldn't find how to change that.</p>

<p>The first textbox is supposed to be a binary-only textbox, only 0s, and 1s allowed. The second and fourth textboxes are supposed to be octal and hex-based ones. My question is, how do I force rewrites on those textboxes? What I am trying to say is that I am looking for a property or event that erases my input if it doesn't match I want in the textbox.</p>

<p>If I type a letter or a number in the binary textbox, it should be erased.
If I type a number greater than 7 or a letter in the octal textbox, erased.
Hexadecimal = no letters other than A-F. And for decimal, no letters. I know how to exclude those values using and if and other nomenclatures, but I am truly lost when it comes to doing it for every textbox.</p>

<p>This is the code:</p>

<pre><code>    window.onload = id;


function id(id) {
  return document.getElementById(id);
}
function Convert(s, n)
 {
  if(parseInt(id(s).value, n)) 
  {

    if(""oct"" != s) { id(""oct"").value = parseInt(id(s).value, n).toString(8) }
    if(""dec"" != s) { id(""dec"").value = parseInt(id(s).value, n).toString(10) }
    if(""hex"" != s) { id(""hex"").value = parseInt(id(s).value, n).toString(16) }
  } else

What the script does is, it logs into an external website <code>example.com</code>, grabs the login cookie and stores it. This cookie works for months! Then goes to <code>example.com/need-to-be-logged-in-to-view-this-page</code> and gets its contents.</p>

<p>However, I face an issue. I have the exact same code on both hosting companies. It works perfectly on hostgator. However, on hostinger, it logs in, grabs the cookie, but the cookie only works that one time when it logs in.</p>

<p>So then I generated the cookie on hostgator and copied that cookie over to hostinger and it worked perfectly. <strong>So I am wondering, is there some sort of setting in cURL or something default that hostgator may have enabled and hostinger may not which makes the cookie generated on hostinger only last for that one second when it logged in.</strong></p>

"57763484","57763484","21","3","<p>I am developing a model of simple car driving simulation in NetLogo. However, I am facing one major and minor problem. The procedures of the model are following: </p>

<p>There must be a car generated in the center of the world with ""size 3"". Car can move only in four directions ""up"", ""down"", ""to_right"" and ""to_left"". When ""go"" button is pressed car starts moving from center to the right. While doing so, buttons, which function at turtle level, ""up"", ""down"", ""to_right"" and ""to_left"" dictate directions of the car. With every press of these buttons ""speed"" of car is increased by the amount of ""acceleration"" and ""tank"" (gas) is decreased by ""dec-tank"". Car moves in a rectangular world (""box""). When car collides with the border or ""walls"" of the world it must: first, move to the opposite direction (to the direction of opposite ""wall"", so to speak ""bounce off""), and second, ""speed"" must drop to its initial level (0.1). My major problem is that when car collides with the ""walls"" of a world, model keeps giving me error ""OF expected input to be a turtle agentset or patch agentset or turtle or patch but got NOBODY instead"". The minor problem is drop of speed does not work as well. I wonder, if there is anybody out there who had similar problems and could help me out with these problems? Thank you in advance!    </p>

<p>I checked every question and answer that I could find here in stackoverflow related with the ""bouncing"" problems in NetLogo models, as well as outside stackoverflow by googling. I tried every answer as a solution, but no avail. As just a part of an experiment to my solution I wrote codes that set the color of car into a ""yellow"" when it reaches the ""walls"". And to my surprize, it seems to be working, but not the codes for the reversal of the car! Also, I tried to substitute both ""max-pxcor"" and ""max-pycor"" for ""nobody"" (in the block of code which supposed to define the reversal of the car), but it did not work either. Also I tried to increase the distance of ""patch-ahead"" and decrease the ""size"" of the car, but results are negative. I do admit that there might some flaws in my codes that I failed to notice, or may be some codes are not ""sanitized"" well enough to go through program as run. My main suspicion is that there could be a problem with the lines of codes which define the reversal of car, or in part of the codes that may seem totally unrelated to the reversal such as ""heading"" or ""forward"" or ""size"" of the car. Following are my codes.       </p>

<p>The overall result of execution of my model is that car must move to opposite direction everytime it collides with ""walls"" and ""speed"" must drop to its initial level. But, I keep having error ""OF expected input to be a turtle agentset or patch agentset or turtle or patch but got NOBODY instead."" I found, while reading other answers here in stackoverflow, that ""NOBODY"" error appears when turtle moves beyond ""walls"" of the world. I wonder why it keeps happening in my case though.</p>

I have my data in a cloud database, fronted by Rest APi's. My app uses storage to store the datetime of when the last upload and download of data was. When i open my app, via start(), it issues a rest call and gets all data, with a datetime stamp > last download datetime. when i close my app i issue another call, via stop(), to send all data locally changed since the last upload datetime, to the cloud. Each record has a lastUpdateDatetime entity property.</p>

<p>The file is really very simple and the only reason I caught this strange situation was because I wanted to test out some error logging tid bits if the package failed.</p>

<p>When trying to purposely crash my package, I took my text file and started putting in random commas in places they shouldn't be and creating random headers that weren't initially defined.  Strangely enough they all imported without issue!</p>

<p>The approved file that should be going through and importing into the system looks something like this</p>

<pre><code>Col1, Col2, Col3
Data1, Data2, Data3
...
</code></pre>

<p>The agreed upon file should ALWAYS be 3 columns with all columns currently being Strings. </p>

<p>When I tried to break my package by doing some of the following</p>

<pre><code>Col1, Col2, Col3, TESTBREAKHDR
Data1, Data2, Data3
...

Col1, Col2, Col3
Data1, Data2, Data3, TESTBREAKDATA
...
</code></pre>

<p>The header was simply disregarded and the data shifted over and was concatenated into the last row.</p>

<p>To me these are errors I want to catch and NOT proceed to do any kind of import.  Since these files are being generated somewhere else and just being picked up by my package for consumption - rather than trying to fix the file before hand (since some investigative work will need to be done prior to fixing) - I want it to simply error out and not proceed with any importing.    </p>

<pre><code>    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        var values = new List&lt;int&gt; { 10, 20, 30 };
        var funcs = new List&lt;Func&lt;int&gt;&gt;();
        foreach (var value in values)
        {
            funcs.Add(() =&gt; value);

        {
            Console.WriteLine((f()));
        }
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>According to the material I have, in C# version 4, 30 should be written to the console 3 times due to the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With C# 4 the compiler defines the loop variable outside of the while
  loop and reuses it with every iteration. Thus, at the end of the loop
  the variable has the value from the last iteration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And in C# 5, the values 10, 20, 30 should be written to the console however, despite changing the C# version (I'm definitely changing the language version and not the .NET framework (although I've tried that as well)) both version write 10, 20, 30 to the console.</p>

<p>I realize this isn't very important but I'm just wondering why this is as it might be something I'm doing wrong and could influence other tests that I try between language versions of C#.</p>

<p>Can canyone explain the machanism or give some some doc links?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I want to delete those objects in the arrays with <code>attributes.type = ""DIMENSION""</code>. I have found two different methods for doing so:</p>

<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>

<pre><code>jQuery.each(itemsOutput, function(i, val) {
    if(val.attributes.type == ""DIMENSION"") // delete index
      {
        delete itemsOutput[i];
      }
});
console.log(itemsOutput.length);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>

<pre><code>metrics = itemsOutput2.filter(function (el) {
            return el.attributes.type === ""METRIC"";
          });
console.log(metrics.length);
</code></pre>

<p>Although both new arrays seem  to have the same number of objects (and in both, all objects with attributes.type = ""DIMENSION"" are gone), the console shows two totally different values for the length of each array.</p>

<p>Method 1 removes the objects, but length is the same as the original array (although exploring the array in the console I observe that the objects keep their original indexes)</p>

<p>Method 2 not only removes the objects, but it also reassings the indexes successively. And for me, the code seems more clear, so I will stay with this method.</p>

<p>My question is, however, why this happens and if there could be problems if I use the results of method 1 in a loop, for example. </p>

<p>I have removed some of the options in the select to condense the code for here. I have also not included the typePicker function because it just displays the html based off the select value. I can edit to include this if it is needed. Stack Overflow says it is too much code not enough content if I add that right now. </p>

For my debugging/development purposes, it could be more convenient that the <code>storeJSON</code> method of the <code>PropertyIndex</code> saves the Properties inside the JSON in the same order that I've declared them in the <code>PropertyBusinessObject</code> or, if it's not possible, in alphabetical order.</p>

<p>Currently the Properties are stored in random order, that is fine for the code, but it's not fine for human reading.</p>

"58659851","58659851","38","6","<p>I'm working with historical data, and have some very old dates that are outside the timestamp bounds for pandas.  I've consulted the Pandas <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Time series/date functionality</a> documentation, which has some information on <a href=""https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#representing-out-of-bounds-spans"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">out of bounds spans</a>, but from this information, it still wasn't clear to me what, if anything I could do to convert my data into a <code>datetime</code> type.</p>

<p>I've also seen a few threads on Stack Overflow on this, but they either just point out the problem (i.e. nanoseconds, max range 570-something years), or suggest setting <code>errors = coerce</code> which turns 80% of my data into <code>NaT</code>s.</p>

<p>Is it possible to turn dates lower than the default Pandas lower bound into dates? Here's a sample of my data:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({'id': ['836', '655', '508', '793', '970', '1075', '1119', '969', '1166', '893'],

But anyway...so I have a simple gui app with a listbox full of folders, and I'm executing an operation on every file in each folder sequentially. This is a very long operation, so I have two progress bars - one for each file, and one for each folder. </p>

<pre><code>private void buttonApplySelected_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    backgroundWorker1.RunWorkerAsync();
}

private void backgroundWorker1_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e)
{
     double percentToIncrement = 100.0 / Convert.ToDouble(selectedDirList.Count);
     double percentComplete = percentToIncrement;
     folderProgressBar.Value = 0;
     foreach (string dir in selectedDirList)
     {
             engine = new OEngine.OEngine(dir, backgroundWorker1);
             engine.ProcessSelected(processType);

             int percentCompleteInt = Convert.ToInt32(percentComplete);
             folderProgressBar.Value = percentCompleteInt;
             percentComplete += percentToIncrement;

}

private void backgroundWorker1_ProgressChanged(object sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e)
{
     fileProgressBar.Value = e.ProgressPercentage;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The BackgroundWorker itself is passed down to the engine, and it updates its progress within the code of the engine processing that folder. (This is probably my first mistake.) The UI catches that ProgressChanged event and updates the fileProgressBar in it's own thread.</p>

<p>But the folderProgressBar needs to be updated once every pass through the for loop, but it gives me <code>Cross-thread operation not valid: Control 'folderProgressBar' accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on.</code></p>

<p>If I move it out of the for loop, it wont update after each folder.
If I move all the UI updating out of the DoWork function, and call the DoWork function in a for loop instead, it obviously doesnt wait for each folder to finish and I get ""the worker is still busy"" exception. </p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Given the data</p>

<pre>
   identifier    category    value
       1           a          40
       1           a          20

       2           b          40
</pre>

<p>What I want to pull out is the following</p>

<pre>
   identifier    category
       1            200
       2            60 
</pre>

<p>In this case, I want to eliminate duplicates as defined by a compound key of identifier + category using MAX on the ""value"" field. That leaves me with the following:</p>

<pre>
   identifier    category    value
       1           a          80
       1           b          80

       2           b          40
</pre>

<p>I then want to SUM ""value"" based on the identifier.</p>

<p>This is another example where I know what I need, but, I'm not sure how to do it in a single SQL statement. I could use a temp table, then run the aggregation (SUM) query on that. But, I'd like to try and get it all with one statement.</p>

<p>I don't need complete file-system level atomicity. That is, if the combined action requires 10 files in the working directory to be changed, it is okay if other processes can observe these 10 changes individually.</p>

<p>I have a matrix of images (basically arranged spheres) with unique id's. I want to add different functionalities to said spheres. So I proceed to add event listeners. All good so far. After the first event is triggered  I want all the spheres to change their event listener, so I proceed to remove all event listeners and add new ones. <strong>I cannot remove the event listeners.</strong></p>

<p>Adding event:</p>

        if ((i &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; i &lt; 9 &amp;&amp; j &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; j &lt; 9) &amp;&amp; checkCorners(i, j) === true) {

            ball.addEventListener('click', removeBall(i, j));

        ball.src = ""./public/assets/ball_empty.png"";
    }
}

<p>I'm using the curried function method because it's the last method I have tried, besides retrieving object data from the e (event) argument, which did not seem to work as e was undefined. Or using a handler. Or  using binding.</p>

<p>Removing event:</p>

<pre><code>for (let i = 0; i &lt; 11; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j &lt; 11; j++) {
        if ((i &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; i &lt; 9 &amp;&amp; j &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; j &lt; 9) &amp;&amp; checkCorners(i, j) === true) {

"35536545","35536545","29","4","<p>I tried to do my best to keep the title short but still informative.</p>

<p>I think I have succeeded with most of it </p>

<p><strong>my problem For Now:</strong>(TLDR below)</p>

<p>I could not succeed implementing a public void method-member, nor an extension to Implement custom <code>ForEach()</code> with index..</p>

<p>as Extension </p>

<pre><code>    public static ListWithCounter&lt;T&gt; ForEach&lt;T&gt;(this  ListWithCounter&lt;T&gt; Self, Action&lt;T&gt; itm)//, ListWithCounter&lt;T&gt; l = l.CurId)
    {

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; Self.Count; i++)
        {
            Self.CurId = i;
            itm(Self[i]);Self.CurId++;

        }
        return Self;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>this is a small issue I guess, the <strong>objectives</strong> :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Create Customized List No Fancy Extra(<em>Expensive</em>) methods</p></li>
<li><p>add an elegant ForEach implementation </p></li>
<li>optional tricks like out of the box <code>GetEnumValues/names</code> <strong>.</strong> <code>To{ourCustomList}()</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>USAGE</strong></p>

<p>in this example I am using an <code>Enum</code> ( names of Actions also used to present action items in console menu)</p>

<pre><code>public enum ActSrptS { CreateMmfTfomFile_DoFormat, OpenExitMmfT, .... }
</code></pre>

<p>so I print it to console by unleashing the power of That small List class</p>

<pre><code>                                    //a struct ConsoleModifiers + ConsoleKey
ActScrptS aAction = ActScrptS._Start; Combination Comb = new Combination();
var actS = aAction._EnmGetValues();
var actSNms = aAction.EnumGetNamesToList().ForEach(Act =&gt;
{
   Console.WriteLine(""[{0}]{1}"", actS.CurId, Act);
});
Console.WriteLine(""===============\r\n"");
Console.WriteLine(""please Select Action"");
</code></pre>

<p>and it's simply using (TRYING without success for now..)</p>

<pre><code>public static ListWithCounter&lt;string&gt; EnumGetNamesToList(this Enum selfEnum)
{
    return selfEnum.GetType().GetFields(BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.Public)
            .Select(f=&gt;f.Name).ToList();
        //var values = Enum.GetNames(typeof(selfEnum)).ToList();
            //return values;
        //var values = Enum.GetValues(typeof(Environment.SpecialFolder)).Cast&lt;Environment.SpecialFolder&gt;().ToList();

}



public static ListWithCounter&lt;Enum&gt; _EnmGetValues(this Enum Self)
{
    ListWithCounter&lt;Enum&gt; enumerations = new ListWithCounter&lt;Enum&gt;();
    foreach (FieldInfo fieldInfo in Self.GetType().GetFields(
              BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.Public))
        {
            enumerations.Add((Enum)fieldInfo.GetValue(Self));
        }
    return enumerations;
}
</code></pre>

<p>so I started with <a href=""http://referencesource.microsoft.com/#mscorlib/system/collections/generic/list.cs"" rel=""nofollow"">MSDN</a> <code>List.cs</code></p>

<p>and I tried to implement as less methods as possible</p>

<ul>
<li>leaving minimal important functionality</li>
<li>altering Growth/Expand for -minimal copying so staring capacity is from say 10-50, multiplied by *4 on each limit...</li>

<p>This works pretty nice, but on iPad, when the effect is in progress, I change the tab and come back later all the letters that are printed in this idle time are shuffled randomly. This does not happen on Desktop.</p>

<p>I guess this has something to do with the idling of the javascript execution when I am idling the tab. And it seems to be browser independent. So I'm guessing that the iPad somehow exeutes all the idled setTimeouts at the same time.? Is there some workaround to still get the letters in the correct order?</p>

A location can be part of an other location, like a State is part of a Country (like the US), but The Netherlands has provinces. Cities can be in a Province but they aren't necessarily part of a province. Partly because some cities are city-state(-like) (i.e. Luxembourg), but in my case it's not even relevant in what province a city is, if there's only one city from a country in my locations list.</p>

<p>This this very simple example:</p>

<pre><code>| types     |
|-----------|
| Continent |
| Country   |
| Province  |
| City      |

| id | name          | type      | parent |

| 3  | Noord-Holland | Province  | 2      |
| 4  | Amsterdam     | City      | 3      |
| 5  | Haarlem       | City      | 3      |
| 6  | Luxembourg    | City      | 1      |
</code></pre>

<p>For every location I want to know their 'geographical parent' (if exist). So the expected outcome is this:</p>

<pre><code>| id | name          | type      | Continent | Country     | Province      |

| 2  | Netherlands   | Country   | Europe    |             |               |
| 3  | Noord-Holland | Province  | Europe    | Netherlands |               |
| 4  | Amsterdam     | City      | Europe    | Netherlands | Noord-Holland |

<blockquote>
  <p>To convert an object to a string, JavaScript takes these steps:<br>
  • If the object has a <code>toString()</code> method, JavaScript calls it. If it returns a primitive value, JavaScript converts that value to a string (if it is not already a string) and returns the result of that conversion. Note that primitive-to-string conversions are all well-defined in Table 3-2.   </p>
  
  <p>• If the object has no <code>toString()</code> method, or if that method does not return a primitive value, then JavaScript looks for a <code>valueOf()</code> method. If the method exists, JavaScript calls it. If the return value is a primitive, JavaScript converts that value to a string (if it is not already) and returns the converted value.   </p>
  
  <p>• Otherwise, JavaScript cannot obtain a primitive value from either <code>toString()</code> or <code>valueOf()</code>, so it throws a TypeError.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>var obj = {
    toString: function() {
        console.log('toStirng...');
        return 90;
    },
    valueOf: function() {
        console.log('valueOf...');
        return 80;
    }
}

console.log(obj + '');
</code></pre>

<p>Accordingly, the code snippet above will convert <code>obj</code> to string because of <code>obj + ''</code>, so it should print:</p>

<pre><code>toString...
90
</code></pre>

<p>But actually, it prints:</p>

<pre><code>valueOf...
80
</code></pre>

<p>So what's wrong? Doesn't <code>obj + ''</code> convert <code>obj</code> to string?  </p>

<p>But I find that now, if there are 3 anchor tags in a page, and the third one has 'next' after it, that the regex search finds a huge string extending from the first anchor tag, and extending to the third anchor tag.   This makes sense if the period-asterisk-questionmark is finding all characters until it comes across "">next"".  But that is not what I want.  I want to find all characters until it comes across "">"", and then an additional constraint should be that right after the "">"" there should be ""next"".</p>

Each time a student visits a record is produced which includes their names, their student number the date they visited, what they were there for and how long they were there.</p>

<p>We create new tables for each term</p>

<p>I was asked to get an unduplicated count of how many students were there during a certain term so I run the following.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `tutoringdata_201350` group by `anum`
</code></pre>

<p><code>anum</code> being the students unique identification number, which returns 524 results out of 5525 total records. In theory that should be my unduplicated count.</p>

<p>I was then asked to get records before and after a certain date in that same table, so I run.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `tutoringdata_201350` WHERE `cDate` &lt;= ""09/30/2013"" group by `anum`
</code></pre>

<p>Which works, so far as the date is concerned and no duplicate people are returned so far as I can see in the results window if I sort by the anumber they are all unique. BUT the total number of results returned is 375</p>

<p>So to get students after that date I run</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `tutoringdata_201350` WHERE `cDate` &gt; ""09/30/2013"" group by `anum`
</code></pre>

<p>which also appears to work, no duplicated students in the returned results but total number of returned results is 428.</p>

<p>375 + 428 is 803 not 524 which I would expect. I'm having trouble following the logic, which of the 2 different types of queries are producing an inaccurate number of results.</p>

<pre><code> import mx.core.Application;     
 import mx.events.FlexEvent;
 import flexunit.framework.TestCase;
public class CustomComponentTest extends TestCase {

override public function tearDown() : void {
 try {
if (component) {
Application.application.removeChild(component);
component = null;
}
} catch (e:Error) {
 }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>First, you need to make sure the component has been fully initialized before you can reliably verify anything about it, and in Flex this happens asynchronously after it has been added to the display list. So you need to setup a callback (using FlexUnit's addAsync function) to be notified when that's happened.
Lately i've been just manually calling the methods that the runtime would call for you in the necessary places, so now my tests tend to look more like this:</p>

<pre><code>import flexunit.framework.TestCase;
public class CustomComponentTest extends TestCase {
public function testSomeAspect() : void {
var component:CustomComponent = new CustomComponent();
 component.initialize();
 component.validateProperties();
 }
</code></pre>

<p>This is much easier to follow, but it kinda feels like I'm cheating a little either way. The first case is slamming it into the current Application (which would be the unit test runner shell app), and the latter isn't a ""real"" environment.I was wondering how other people would handle this sort of situation?</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Now, imagine a wrapper function: inside it I have defined several sympy expressions, each using different Latex symbols. I give an index argument to this function, which is used to return the lambdify version of the corresponding expression.</p>

<p>When the lambdify function is returned, I would really love to know what <code>_Dummy_</code> is referring to, especially when the lambdify function requires two or more arguments to be evaluated. For instance, in the above example I would have no problem if the function argument was called <code>AoB</code> (which I can interpret as alpha over beta).</p>

<p>Ideally, I would love to create a Symbol that accepts both Latex (for visualization purposes) and also a fallback symbol to be used whenever a Dummy variable is going to be created (for example, with lambdify). Is it possible?</p>

<p>I tried the following formula set:</p>

<ol>
<li>In cell D1 of ""Sheet Name2"" I go <code>=MATCH(B1, 'Sheet Name1'!B:B, 0)</code> which gives me 1</li>
<li>In cell E1 of ""Sheet Name2"" I go <code>=CONCAT(""'Sheet Name1'!C"", D1)</code> which gives me <code>'Sheet Name1'!C1</code></li>
<li>But now when I go <code>=ArrayFormula(E1)</code> I get <code>'Sheet Name1'!C1</code> again. While if I go <code>=ArrayFormula('Sheet Name1'!C1)</code> I get the URL I want, <code>http://bobsmith.com</code>.</li>

So there is a difference here. But what would be the effective difference? Are these real method references as in Java or are they rather a reflection way to access properties? Will one variant probably have any performance impact over the other?</p>

<p>I'm working with a matrix of distances between individuals and events, and I want to transform the matrix based on characteristics of the events and the individuals. In this case, I want to know if an individual was exposed to an event within certain distance based on other criteria.</p>

<p>Let's say we have two vectors, one of 4 individuals and another of 3 events. We obtain a matrix of the distances in km between individuals and events:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; dist_mat = matrix(runif(12, 1, 100), ncol = 3)
&gt; dist_mat
         [,1]      [,2]      [,3]
[1,] 21.318423 89.79522 75.29824
[2,] 36.812542 18.28413 92.90719
[3,] 45.012960 89.11778 38.55608
[4,]  8.470336 46.17020 26.67135
</code></pre>

<p>On top of that, I know when the individuals were born and when the events took place, which is stored in two vectors:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; event_year = c(2003, 2005, 2009)
&gt; indiv_born = c(2004, 2004, 2008, 2008)
</code></pre>

<p>My goal is to know if an individual was exposed to an event within  that took place after she was born and within, say, 30km. My solution at this point is to expand the year vectors into matrices and work it out from there, and then use <code>rowSums</code> to obtain an indicator of whether an individual was exposed to such event:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; event_year_m = matrix(rep(event_year, each = nrow(x1)), ncol = ncol(x1))
&gt; indiv_born_m = matrix(rep(indiv_year, each = ncol(x1)), byrow = TRUE, ncol = ncol(x1))
&gt; event_year_m

&gt; indiv_year_m
     [,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 2004 2004 2004
[2,] 2004 2004 2004
[3,] 2008 2008 2008
[4,] 2008 2008 2008

&gt; dist_mat[event_year_m &lt; indiv_year_m] = NA

&gt; dist_mat[dist_mat &gt;= 30] = 0

&gt; indiv_exposure = rowSums(dist_mat, na.rm = TRUE)

One of the requirements is to expose an interface for external developers to add further functionalities. So far I have proposed a MVC 2-tier architecture, where the View and Controller run in the user's machine, and the Model is hosted in an Application server and remotely invoked. The requirement on functionalities suggests me to use a plugin pattern.</p>

<p>Additional steps selected by the user might be executed when processing the information, so I wanted to model them as plugins that will already exist when the application is released. This means that this plugins would affect the same resource (the processing flow), and I am uncertain about how to deal with this when both plugins are enabled.</p>

<p>Since I am not as familiar with the plugin pattern as with other patterns, the reading I did before asking made me try something similar to the Abstract Factory pattern. The problem is that, when two or more plugins are enabled, I would need mutiple inheritance. I also thought of the Builder pattern to model steps of the processing separately, but then an order among plugins would have to be defined and this would affect the independence of plugin's developers.</p>

    int operator()() { // Not const
        return my_mutable++;
    }

<p>Note that <code>mutable_callable</code> has a non-const <code>operator()</code> that modifies a member variable.....</p>

<h2>Update: Final full working solution</h2>

<p>Thanks to @melvin, and to provide clarity for anyone else who may find this later, here's what I ended up with:</p>

<p>Parent theme function:</p>

<pre><code>function custom_function( $additional_domains ) { 
    $allowed_domains = array(
        'domain1.com',
        'domain2.com',
        'domain3.com',
    );

    $additional_domains = apply_filters( 'add_to_allowed_domains', $additional_domains );

    if ( !empty($additional_domains) ) {
        $allowed_domains = array_merge( $allowed_domains, $additional_domains );
    }

    print_r( $allowed_domains );
}
add_action('admin_head', 'custom_function');
</code></pre>

<p>Child theme function &amp; filter:</p>

<pre><code>add_filter('add_to_allowed_domains','add_to_domains_fn');
function add_to_domains_fn($domains){
   $domains= array('domain4.com','domain5.com');
   return $domains;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The parent theme function still works with the original allowed domains defined within it. If the child theme includes add_to_domains_fn() and the filter, it adds the additional domains in as expected.</p>

<p>The query below is an example of code to read a DMV for a potentially missing column.  The code creates a default value for the column and uses <code>CROSS APPLY</code> to extract the actual column, if it exists, from the DMV.</p>

<p>The column the code tries to extract, BogusColumn, does not exist.  I would expect the query below to generate an error about an invalid column name... but it does not.  It returns NULL without error.</p>

<p><strong>Why does the CROSS APPLY clause below NOT result in an ""invalid column name"" error?</strong></p>

<pre><code>declare @x int

(
    select cast(null as int) as BogusColumn
) a
cross apply
(
    select BogusColumn from sys.dm_exec_sessions
) b;
select @x;
</code></pre>

<p>If I run the query in the <code>CROSS APPLY</code> separately:</p>

<pre><code>select BogusColumn from sys.dm_exec_sessions;
</code></pre>

<p>I get an expected error about an invalid column name:</p>

<pre><code>Msg 207, Level 16, State 1, Line 9

<p>Now, I tried to fix it by redefining the environment (closure) of the prior function using <code>environment(prior) &lt;- list2env(list(exp.value = exp.value))</code>:</p>

<p>I haven't seen a single guide mention if you can expect identical behavior regardless of what object <code>after</code> is called on.

<pre><code>$('div').animate({ width: 'toggle' });
</code></pre>

<p>However, a new problem arises when text is in the element - the animated width introduces word wrap and other sensitive elements react poorly.</p>

<p>When animating, the height of it jumps all over the place and the effect is quite unpleasant. This snippet fully demonstrates the problem:</p>

<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">

<p>One possible explanation for this wide discrepancy is that the stylesheet for this page includes <em>some combination</em> of declarations that is not covered by the CSS specification, meaning that each browser is free to interpret it arbitrarily.  (In this case, for example, the ""out-of-spec combination"" may be the pair of declarations <code>max-width: 400px;</code> and <code>display:table;</code> for the <code>.main</code> selector.)</p>

<p>Question: <strong>Is there some automated way to detect such ""out-of-spec"" combinations of declarations?</strong></p>

<p>It is worthwhile to note that the example given here may be <em>relatively</em> easy to diagnose by inspection (at least for someone with a very thorough command of the CSS spec), but it's no stretch to imagine situations in which such ""out-of-spec"" combinations may arise much more subtly (e.g. by interactions between declarations in separate stylesheets, etc.).  Therefore, some tool to identify such ""out-of-spec"" combinations would be a huge help.</p>

<p>The only tool I could think of for this sort of thing was <a href=""http://csslint.net"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CSS Lint</a>, but it does not pick up anything in the CSS that may lead to fixing the discrepancy illustrated above.</p>

<p>Calls that don't involve parameters seem to work fine. Ex,</p>

<pre><code>$client-&gt;GetContactsDataTableXMLSchema();
</code></pre>

<p>And the result is what you probably would expect, an XML schema of a contact Table. No problems there.</p>

<p>HOWEVER,</p>

<p>Any time I try to make a call that involves a parameter all heck breaks loose and all I ever get is the error:</p>

<pre><code>No matching ExtType found

<p>Is this a standard MS .NET error? Is this something I am doing wrong in PHP Soap? I can't really share the soap end point because it is private/confidential along with the WSDL.</p>

<p>The first 3 params were given to me be the webservice maker and defined in in C# example they made. The last parameter is the client we want to fetch which in the Visual Studio C# example app they gave works. </p>

<p>Lastly,</p>

<p>Will I have any chance at all when the result does come back of actually reading and decoding the data in the results?</p>

<p>I have a bad feeling that the results are going to be a MS .NET dataTable that has to be decoded from a byte stream.</p>

The code is the following:</p>

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
from datetime import days
a = pd.Series(range(0,25,1), index=pd.date_range('2011-1-1',periods=25))
store_before_cleanse = a.index

            i = i-1
        i = i + 1
    return x

Trying to use the ie inspector is making me want to claw my eyes out so help is appreciated. Is there a keyword I'm missing or an extra step needed to get a scroll action for i.e.?</p>

<p>I've been using Git for my projects for years now, but only now I started working in a big company on a repo that ~100 developers commit to. When I was working alone and in small teams, I've gotten used to making lots of commits all the time, staging all the files, and using an empty commit message (yes, that's the way I roll.) I basically used commits as an extended save operation; whenever I typed a non-trivial amount of code, I committed it all and pushed to a non-master branch.</p>

<p>Now that I work in a big company I can't do that, because it'll be a nuisance to the other people. So I still do frequent, undocumented commits, but when I'm done I squash all of them by rebasing, give them a nice informative commit message, and send a merge request with just that commits. All my interim commits will be deleted on the next garbage-collection run.</p>

<p>I don't like how all my interim commits are deleted. They may be ugly, but I love them. Sometimes they have bits of code that I've written and then deleted, and I don't want to lose that code. Maybe I'll need it again in the future.</p>

<p>Now, I could put all of these commits on a private branch. But it'll be a nuisance to create and maintain such a set of branches. Because it means that every feature branch will now need another auxiliary branch that'll stay open and unmerged forever. Yuck.</p>

<p><strong>What I want is a system that saves any commit made in Git and ensures it'll stay accessible for the foreseeable future.</strong> It's important to me that this will be automatic, without needing to take any action. I want to know that I can go back to any commit I made, even if it was lost in a squash.</p>

<p>Id was generated based on <code>MyDBSequence</code>.For example id has value = <code>100</code>.</p>

<p>But after <code>MyJpaRepo</code> saved <code>MyEntity</code>, database executed trigger on table with <code>MyEntity</code>. This trigger increase id (Don't ask why. This is legacy code). Now in base its valu is <code>101</code>. But i have value <code>100</code> in <code>id</code> field.</p>

<p><strong>Is there any way to get factual id after <code>MyJpaRepo.save(new MyEntity)</code>, that was generated after trigger execution?</strong></p>

<p>I can't edit this trigger now. This is legacy code that need to be support for this moment.</p>

<p>See fiddle: <a href=""https://jsfiddle.net/723xhcrf/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://jsfiddle.net/723xhcrf/</a></p>

<p>When you create an element with params the width and height (maybe more) are added to the style argument like so:</p>

<pre class=""lang-js prettyprint-override""><code>$('&lt;div&gt;', {'width': '50px', 'height': '50px'});
</code></pre>

<p>Gives</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""width: 50px; height: 50px;""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But when you already have a style something strange happens based on the order of the keys of the params object.</p>

<pre><code>$('&lt;div&gt;', {'width': '50px', 'style': 'background-color:blue;', 'height': '50px'})
</code></pre>

<p>gives</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""background-color: blue; height: 50px;""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And</p>

<pre><code>$('&lt;div&gt;', {'height': '50px', 'style': 'background-color:blue;', 'width': '50px'})
</code></pre>

<p>gives</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style=""background-color: blue; width: 50px;""&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What you see here is that the first width or height (maybe more) are overwritten by the style attribute that comes after it. I expect that both width and height in both cases are appended to the style attribute.</p>

<p>So my solution is to have a function that orders the params so that the style param is always the first key in the params object.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With this change, array-type fields in the destination SQL type are properly converted from JSON arrays, and composite-type fields are properly converted from JSON objects. Previously, such cases would fail because the text representation of the JSON value would be fed to array_in() or record_in(), and its syntax would not match what those input functions expect.</p>

        System.out.println(b);

}

<p>We got an error</p>

<p>And then we changed the code as follows</p>

<pre><code>class Casting1 {

        final int i = 10;
        byte b = i;
        System.out.println(10);
    }
}

10
</code></pre>

<p>We got the correct output. As for the reason, he told that when we modify a variable <code>final</code> the variable is stored in the smallest data type possible. In this case was a <code>byte</code>. That's the reason that we were able to cast that without using the cast keyword.</p>

<p>But when we use method overloading like this,</p>

<pre><code>class A {
    void m(int i){
        System.out.println(""int"");
    }
    void m(byte b){
        System.out.println(""byte"");

        A a1 = new A();
        final int i = 10;
        a1.m(i);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I get the output <code>int</code>. If the final variables are stored in the lowest possible data type, it should be <code>byte</code>. So I tried the following code without overloading.</p>

<pre><code>class A {
    void m(byte b){
        System.out.println(""byte"");

    public static void main(String args[]){

<p>The odd thing is, when I input <code>63</code> into the function (the minimum value that produces this), it gives me back <code>-1</code>. At <code>62</code>, it gives back <code>9223372036854775807</code>, so this seems to be caused by an overflow.</p>

<p>Shouldn't it give me back the minimum value of Java's long + the amount that it was overflowed by? Regardless of the input that I give it though (passed <code>62</code>), it will always return <code>-1</code> instead of a seemingly random number that I'd expect from an overflow.</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure how to debug this, since it's recursive, and the value I'm interested in will only be evaluated once the the function has reached the base-case.</p>

"30584598","30584598","99","13","<p>So this is my question: <strong>Why would calling a method be faster then retrieving something from memory?</strong></p>

<p>Noticed when an id attribute is specified on a DOM element, user agents automatically attach the element's reference on their global scope. </p>

<p>Since user agents already reference all elements, which have their id attribute specified, why would I need to use document.getElementById("""")?</p>

<p>Within an application, I would:</p>

<pre><code>//Retrieving the value, I could possibly write this two way.
&lt;script&gt;
var fromGlobalScope = myElement.value;
var documentGetById = document.getElementById(""myElement"").value;
&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;input id=""myElement"" value=""someValue"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Doing some research, it is supported by all major browser, but their may some browser that do not support, which will break.</p>

<p>However, I could simply write:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script&gt;

//See if the element is on the global scope.
var fromGlobalScope = myElement ||document.getElementById(""myElement"");

&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I believe patterned correctly, I can automatically have references to all elements that have an id attribute. I don't have to call document.getElementById();</p>

<p>Using an resident property and I wouldn't have to walk the DOM, would think there would be a good performance benefit.</p>

<p>I created a jsPerf to see the benefit: <a href=""http://jsperf.com/dom-to-reference"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enter link description here</a></p>

<p>My surprise was using document.getElementById() was a lot faster?</p>

<p>So this is my question: <strong>Why would calling a method be faster then retrieving something from memory?</strong></p>

<p>Using document.getElementById, I would be calling a method that may or may not walk the DOM. At least, I will be calling an address for the value.</p>

<p>With a property on the global scope that should be quickly available as it is placed in some memory location.</p>

<p>I have include jsPerf results below:
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/rcl8g.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I created another jsPerf with another thought:
<a href=""http://jsperf.com/memeory-vs-method"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">explicitly setting a property on the window object</a></p>

<p>However, I still believe learning why can help with the mechanics that are at play, which may result in something helpful.  </p>
