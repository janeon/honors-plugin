<p>And the database handler to get all of the rows:</p>

        }

        // return contact list
        return poidsList;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>To finish how I call it:</p>

<pre><code>    db.getAllPoids();
    List&lt;Poids&gt; poids = db.getAllPoids();

    ListView listView=(ListView) view.findViewById(R.id.listView);

    newData = new ArrayList&lt;String&gt;();

        //String log = ""Id: "" + val.getId() + "" ,Date: "" + val.getDate_enr() + "" ,Poids: "" + val.getPoids() + "" ,Evolution: "" + val.getEvolution() ;
        // Writing Contacts to log

    }

    PoidsAdapter  mAdapter = new PoidsAdapter(getActivity(), R.layout.listpoids, newData);
    listView.setAdapter(mAdapter);
</code></pre>

<p>But it doesn't work, I'm in a fragment.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<pre><code>@Override

    final ViewHolder holder;
        LayoutInflater inflater = (LayoutInflater) mContext.getSystemService(Context.LAYOUT_INFLATER_SERVICE);

        holder.mTvTitle.setText(poids.getDate_enr().toString());
        holder.mTvMediaName.setText(String.valueOf(poids.getPoids()).toString());

    return view;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think the error is here beceuse I see the two rows, but at setAdapter or something like this, here is missing something i think:</p>

<pre><code>public class MonPoidsFragment extends Fragment {

<p>This question is raised because i had a lecture about CNN today. The reason why we use CNN is that we want to extract the features of images and decrease the dimensions of the input data. Since we keep making the input for each layer smaller and smaller, why not just use one neuron and make network deeper? Or something bad will happen?</p>

<p><strong>What I want to do and my issue:</strong>
Each fragment will describe different topics, therefore I will probably use a spinner to access those differnt topics. </p>

<p><strong>What I am asking for:</strong>
Each topic will have a lot of text and images, what is the best way for me to tackle the problem?</p>

<p><strong>My own ideas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set up new fragments in the fragment, which will get called via the <code>getChildrenFragmentManager()</code> through the choice in the spinner. From what I found out, it is not the best way to use fragments in fragments and it also seems like an overkill. Do you have suggestions?</li>
<li>Using HTML to provide a more convinient way of setting up the guides instead of using 10 textviews followed by imagesviews each time.</li>

It seems like it should be simple, but Im either getting answers that tell me to press a ""Delete Account"" button in my dashboard that simply IS NOT there, or someone says ""look it up on Google"" or something else that is not at all helpful. I've looked and am getting very frustrated. So, here's my question(s): </p>

<ol>
<li><p>If I cancel the hosting (Blue Host), will it automatically cancel all payments relating to the site? That is, is signing up on WordPress free, with the hosting being the part that is paid? I can't find statements or anything related to the WordPress part of it, so I'm hoping that the hosting is the only part I'm paying for (this site was started a few years ago, and I just don't have time for it, so I don't remember anymore.)</p></li>
<li><p>Can a Wordpress.org account/site actually be deleted? I've emptied all the contents as stated in the documentation, but when it comes to actually pressing ""Delete Account,"" the button is no where to be found in my dashboard! As long as I'm not paying for it to just sit there, I guess I can leave it, but I'd prefer to delete it altogether, if possible.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you to anyone who offers constructive advice on this topic. I know others have asked about this, but none of those solutions have worked, so I'm asking again. (It also doesn't help that WordPress doesn't offer direct support, only forums, so if you happen to know of a good resource outside of their own documentation--which, as stated, hasn't helped me--I'll appreciate the referral.)</p>

<p>Problem Statement
As outlined in the background story, you are in the middle of a shark-infested
ocean. The sandbank along which you may travel is very narrow (only wide
enough to walk in a straight line with a little room to make turns) and is
bordered by electric wire along the edges i.e. if you touch off the wire, you will be electrocuted and fall into the ocean – a state from which there is no return.</p>

<p>The years in prison have taken their toll both physically and mentally. Due to
adverse sleeping conditions, sensory deprivation and regular beatings, your
senses are poor and movements now restricted to taking 1 exact same step
at a time in a forwards direction (i.e. the direction in which you are facing).
Also, you are no longer able to turn left and turning to the right can only be
done 90 degrees at a time. 2.) the only data you are able to store in your
memory is limited to a single integer value (it may be possible to scrounge up
some space to store a boolean value, though you're unlikely to need this).</p>

<p>Luckily, you can still do the basic arithmetic operations of addition and
subtraction. To aid your decision-making and control of repetitive actions you
know about an IF statement and WHILE loop. You also recognise a true or
false response to a question and can test the values of integers using any of
the operators &lt;, >, ≤ and ≥. Of course, you also know about the interger
values 0, 1, 2 etc.. Unfortunately, logical operations are beyond your current
processing power. Any further assumptions should be confirmed by the tutor.</p>

<p>In a rare display of compassion HAL has permitted that you be allowed ask 3
questions, to which you will receive a true or false response: “in front of
gate?”, “in front of wire?” and “in front of sand?”. You may also ask the
complement of these questions i.e. “not in front of gate?”, “not in front of
wire?” and “not in front of sand?”. There is no restriction on how many times
you may ask these questions and these states cannot exist at the same time.</p>

"39156347","39156347","22","-5","<p>So I am in process of coding class for some graph structure (suffix tree), and I encountered this difficult thing: a node should have pointers, one pointing on its parent, and also a set of pointers to its sons. I am using smart pointers to avoid errors with memory, and here is the thing: I write</p>

<pre><code>class node { 
    ...
    std::shared_ptr&lt;node&gt; parent; 
    ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>I guess there is a term for this thing. Like self-referencing, or whatever. When I wrote it, initialy i was confident, that there will be an error, but no it had been successfully compiled. I was curious, can i write something like that: </p>

<pre><code>class some_class_2{ 
    ...
    std::vector&lt;some_class_2&gt; some_vector; 
    std::string string_; 
    some_class() { 
        string_ = ""lol"";
        some_vector = std::vector&lt;some_class&gt;(10); 
    }
 };
</code></pre>

<p>Its appeared that the answer on this question is yes. So when i launched the test programm which had been succesfully compiled, of course it wouldn't stop, maybe i waited not enough and it should throw me some memory related error. </p>

<p>So the question is, how you should handle with this kind of things in c++? Isn't it strange that those things allowed in c++? Is it normal to put std::shatre_ptr inside some_class? How to write safe code, where errors like in some_class_2 are avoided, and what is the best way to 
represent graph structure? </p>
