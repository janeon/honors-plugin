<p>My site is <a href=""http://f24.f99.myftpupload.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://f24.f99.myftpupload.com/</a> </p>

<p>I added to .container - width: 100%, margin: 0px, padding: 0px 
- which pulled the navigation full width like I wanted but it also pulled all of my page content out to the edge of the window which I don't want.
Is there any easy/possible way to get the page content to stay pushed in off the edge but pull the navigation full width? </p>

<p>I am also having an issue with my meta slider on the Research page - it sits within a tabbed container on the page - it was working perfectly fine then I shuffled some on top of others and changed their section ID and now when first loaded it pushes all of the content in to a single column, one letter per line, but if you refresh or inspect the page it puts it back as it should be. 
I have no idea what is causing this or how to fix it. Can anyone help?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>But it doesn't work, I'm in a fragment.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

        holder.mTvTitle.setText(poids.getDate_enr().toString());
        holder.mTvMediaName.setText(String.valueOf(poids.getPoids()).toString());

    return view;
}

<p>I think the error is here beceuse I see the two rows, but at setAdapter or something like this, here is missing something i think:</p>

<pre><code>public class MonPoidsFragment extends Fragment {

<p>Is there any syntax I could use for this, or any idea on how this could be done?</p>

My problem is that, the height of that div is big enough that only half of it is being displayed on the page. My expectation at first is that, a vertical scroll bar will show up since the size ""<strong>overflows the default size (height) of the body</strong>"". But I was wrong. I think when I make its (div) position to relative, I detach it from the space reserved on the body thus the body can only see its original space being occupied. And when I moved it at the bottom center part of the page, the body can only see its original space being occupied (<strong>before the div was moved</strong>), that's why there's no vertical scroll bar displayed to indicate that there are still contents to be displayed.</p>

<p>Now, how can I make, or is there even a way to make the body track where that div is being placed. So if that div is placed somewhere near at the edge of the page, and its height or width is big enough to expand the size of the container, it should show a scroll bar to indicate that there are more contents to display.</p>

<p>This is how it currently looked like:

<pre><code>if(minutes &lt;= 9){

    minutesString = ""0"" + minutesString; }

if(seconds &lt;= 9){
    secondsString = ""0"" + secondsString; }

// This code works and shows my time with zeros (01:00)

if(seconds &lt;= 9 &amp;&amp; minutes &lt;= 9){
    secondsString = ""0"" + secondsString;
    minutesString = ""0"" + minutesString; }

// This code doesnt work, it only has zero on minute till seconds are 
//less than 9, after that minuts are single digit

I am using smart pointers to avoid errors with memory, and here is the thing: I write</p>

<pre><code>class node { 
    ...
    std::shared_ptr&lt;node&gt; parent; 
    ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>I guess there is a term for this thing. Like self-referencing, or whatever. When I wrote it, initialy i was confident, that there will be an error, but no it had been successfully compiled. I was curious, can i write something like that: </p>

<pre><code>class some_class_2{ 
    ...
    std::vector&lt;some_class_2&gt; some_vector; 
    std::string string_; 
    some_class() { 
        string_ = ""lol"";
        some_vector = std::vector&lt;some_class&gt;(10); 
    }
 };
</code></pre>

<p>Its appeared that the answer on this question is yes. So when i launched the test programm which had been succesfully compiled, of course it wouldn't stop, maybe i waited not enough and it should throw me some memory related error. </p>

<p>So the question is, how you should handle with this kind of things in c++? Isn't it strange that those things allowed in c++? Is it normal to put std::shatre_ptr inside some_class? How to write safe code, where errors like in some_class_2 are avoided, and what is the best way to 
represent graph structure? </p>

5- A button to delete the current image (until they are 3 images, the gallery must not contain less than 3 images).
6- Buttons to move in the gallery (Forward and Backward, taking into account it is circular gallery).
7- Each image is clickable, in which when an image is clicked, it appears in a separate place (of course the gallery keeps evolving the images).
8- A list contains the names of the images, so that when an image name is selected, it appears in the gallery.
9- Two buttons: begin and end, the first displays the first image, and the second displays the last image.

What would be the easiest way to do that, to only get the used Javascript and CSS?</p>

<p>EDIT: The page is actually a styleguide which needs to get distributed and normalized. So I don't want to forward the whole application source-code, just one html-file with one Javascript (where only the code which is needed is inside it) and only the used CSS. This would be best-case.

Then i used the socket to send each time MAX_BUFFER_SIZE bytes from the array
as fragments.
But it's not Effcient enough since the array size sent is about 10M, and there will be alot of buffering when the stream will be desplayed.
I can't compress the array too since it's an OMEGA(n) operation, SO
First of all , what protocol is better for this problem? UDP, TCP ?
And in general , how can i send that huge array over socket in a video streaming efficiency level ?</p>

<p>Each Player can play many characters. With each character, he has specific stats (Number of Kills, Deaths, Win Rate, number of games played etc). I have a table ""PLAYERS"" with all the players. I would like to rank Players by character according to one of the parameter (Win Rate for example). This ranking will be refreshed every hour, so my top priority is the speed of  the update.
My developer is suggesting me to create a table where each row represent the couple (Player, Character) and then there will be as many fields as stats.
I'm just worried about the future performance of such a table, because we have currently 10K Players in our base, around 100 characters for each player : 1Million rows.</p>

<p>But in the future, I expect there will be around 1Million players in the data base, which makes it 100Million Rows. Is it an optimal solution in term of speed?
I thought about using an additional single field in the table PLAYERS that would contain all the stats (""Win Rate : 50%; Number of Games played : 845 etc.). The size of the database will be 100 times smaller, but the process of ranking by charater will imply to search a Json field everytime, which might takes longer.</p>

<p>What do yo guys think?

<p><strong>What I want to do and my issue:</strong>
Each fragment will describe different topics, therefore I will probably use a spinner to access those differnt topics. </p>

<p><strong>What I am asking for:</strong>
Each topic will have a lot of text and images, what is the best way for me to tackle the problem?</p>

<p><strong>My own ideas:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set up new fragments in the fragment, which will get called via the <code>getChildrenFragmentManager()</code> through the choice in the spinner. From what I found out, it is not the best way to use fragments in fragments and it also seems like an overkill. Do you have suggestions?</li>
<li>Using HTML to provide a more convinient way of setting up the guides instead of using 10 textviews followed by imagesviews each time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I teach a class in computer programming where we have been making a version of Master Mind. </p>

<p>An odd thing happened which I don't understand and can't duplicate. The playing board depicted above is created with a picturebox array, which -- as you will all know -- has to be created programmatically. As you would expect, the x and y coordinates were meant to be controlled by using new location coordinates.</p>

<p>One of the students must have changed a property in the panel. As a result of this change -- which I can't duplicate -- when  the picture boxes were created on the fly, they would appear in the panel without being given any horizontal or vertical assignments! He couldn't figure out why they were locating incorrectly in a pattern that had nothing to do with the location variables. We placed apostrophes before all mentions of the x and y variables. We then eliminated them altogether. We then did the same to the location property, and so removed any and all location references. Nothing stopped the appearance of the boxes in an ungoverned array pattern. The pattern would change with the panel being expanded or contracted.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one of the other students deleted the panel and when we replaced it with a new one -- problem solved. However, the result is that I don't know what particular property caused this anomaly. I've played around for half an hour enabling and disabling various properties but nothing. I can't duplicate what he did.</p>

<p>I have a website in which at the top of each page, I insert a banner that I have created which has the page title in it. This is what the banner looks like:
<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/kpXXd.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enter image description here</a></p>

<p>Now normally I have to create a banner in Photoshop for each separate page and it is a bit time-consuming especially since there are so many pages. I was wondering if there was some way to use CSS styling so that I only need to upload the front part of the banner i.e. the crocodile head (this one: <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/y1iTC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">enter image description here</a>)and then use CSS styling to create the black banner and the text that follows it. The banner:
1. Must have the exact same height as the neck of the croc.
2. The length should be able to be resized based on how long the text inside it is
3. Must have Arial Black fonts text in white color on top of it.</p>

<p>I'd greatly appreciate any help in this issue. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Edit: I had tried doing the CSS coding myself but it didn't work. I just didn't know that I had to post it here as well. This is what I tried first:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=""Logo-Red.jpg""  height=""53"" style=""float-left"" /&gt;
    &lt;p style=""color:#FFF; font:'Arial Black', Gadget, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; background-color:#9e0000; margin-top:5x; height:30px; padding:5px;"" &gt;SPECIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But that just put the logo and text on separate lines. So I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;p style=""color:#FFF; font:'Arial Black', Gadget, sans-serif; font-weight:bold; background-color:#000; margin-top:5x; height:30px; padding:5px;""&gt;&lt;img src=""Logo-Red.jpg""  height=""53"" style=""float-left"" /&gt;
    &gt;SPECIES
        &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But that didn't work either. The text did move up but was not aligned properly.</p>

<p>I didn't realize that people here were so rude. I thought this was a place where people could get help and learn. That's what it says on the front page in bold. I'm a newbie so if I made a mistake in my post, you can tell me how to correct it without being patronizing and discourteous.</p>

<p>I used this query to get the posts details + the user name and avatar + how many times this post is bookmarked by the users</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
    posts.*, users.name, users.avatar , 
    COUNT(bookmarks.post_id) AS bookmarksCount   
FROM 
    posts 
LEFT JOIN 
    users ON users.id = posts.owner
LEFT JOIN
    bookmarks ON bookmarks.post_id = posts.id    
GROUP BY 
    posts.id;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything is OK so far.</p>

<p>The problem: I wanted to get the <code>SUM()</code> of the claps for each post so I added 2 more lines to the previous query, this is the query now:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT posts.*, users.name, users.avatar , 
    count(bookmarks.post_id) as bookmarksCount ,
    SUM(claps.claps_count) AS totalClaps
    FROM posts 
    LEFT JOIN users ON users.id = posts.owner
    LEFT Join bookmarks ON bookmarks.post_id = posts.id
    LEFT JOIN claps ON claps.post_id = posts.id
    GROUP BY posts.id
    ;
</code></pre>

<p>The problem is that the result of the claps of the post.id ""2"" is doubled it's 40 instead of 20,</p>

<p>It's like the join of the count() of the bookmarks of the post is causing the problem, in other words if the sum() of the claps are 10 and the post is bookmarked 5 times after count() than the result of the claps will be 50 instead of 5.</p>

<p>I tried to subquery the sum() of the claps but I didn't know how to do it.</p>

<p>Can you please give me the solution in subquery way with a some explanation because I will add the count() of the comments later on and maybe more subqueries too</p>

<p>Thank you in advance</p>

<li><p>If I cancel the hosting (Blue Host), will it automatically cancel all payments relating to the site? That is, is signing up on WordPress free, with the hosting being the part that is paid? I can't find statements or anything related to the WordPress part of it, so I'm hoping that the hosting is the only part I'm paying for (this site was started a few years ago, and I just don't have time for it, so I don't remember anymore.)</p></li>
<li><p>Can a Wordpress.org account/site actually be deleted? I've emptied all the contents as stated in the documentation, but when it comes to actually pressing ""Delete Account,"" the button is no where to be found in my dashboard! As long as I'm not paying for it to just sit there, I guess I can leave it, but I'd prefer to delete it altogether, if possible.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Thank you to anyone who offers constructive advice on this topic. I know others have asked about this, but none of those solutions have worked, so I'm asking again. (It also doesn't help that WordPress doesn't offer direct support, only forums, so if you happen to know of a good resource outside of their own documentation--which, as stated, hasn't helped me--I'll appreciate the referral.)</p>

bordered by electric wire along the edges i.e. if you touch off the wire, you will be electrocuted and fall into the ocean – a state from which there is no return.</p>

<p>The years in prison have taken their toll both physically and mentally. Due to
adverse sleeping conditions, sensory deprivation and regular beatings, your
senses are poor and movements now restricted to taking 1 exact same step
at a time in a forwards direction (i.e. the direction in which you are facing).
Also, you are no longer able to turn left and turning to the right can only be
done 90 degrees at a time. 2.) the only data you are able to store in your
memory is limited to a single integer value (it may be possible to scrounge up
some space to store a boolean value, though you're unlikely to need this).</p>

<p>Luckily, you can still do the basic arithmetic operations of addition and
subtraction. To aid your decision-making and control of repetitive actions you
know about an IF statement and WHILE loop. You also recognise a true or
false response to a question and can test the values of integers using any of
the operators &lt;, >, ≤ and ≥. Of course, you also know about the interger
values 0, 1, 2 etc.. Unfortunately, logical operations are beyond your current
processing power. Any further assumptions should be confirmed by the tutor.</p>

<p>In a rare display of compassion HAL has permitted that you be allowed ask 3
questions, to which you will receive a true or false response: “in front of
gate?”, “in front of wire?” and “in front of sand?”. You may also ask the
complement of these questions i.e. “not in front of gate?”, “not in front of
wire?” and “not in front of sand?”. There is no restriction on how many times
you may ask these questions and these states cannot exist at the same time.</p>

<p>And this is how the data looks like: 4;""false"";""null"";""null"";""Osebni avto"";""20"";""PoboÄje"";""5.0"";""3-9m3  (velikost osebnega avtomobila)"";""3.0"";""null"";""30"";""10"";""10"";""null"";""null"";""null"";""50"";""false"";""</p>

Although, I want to make admins for each and one of my classmates to only and only create and publish posts on the web. For example, BuzzFeed has admins that create content and it tells the author name, date and time, comments and responses next to it. That's what I am aiming for. Not all of my classmates use wordpress or have ever used it so I want to find a way to create admins for them simply without creating security holes for the website itself and risking getting hacks or login attempts. </p>

I tried ""setTokens(10);"" which should apparently set the token amount to 10, and it does, but once the page is refreshed, the token amount is then reset back to it's original amount. I've tested other functions of this nature in the console as well and everything is then reset after a refresh. Is there a certain reason why this happening and/or a way to actually make the function work properly? Thanks!</p>

<p>PS: I'm not very experienced with web development so sorry if this problem has a really easy solution.</p>

<p>This is the function which set's the tokens.</p>

"44215515","44215515","20","-4","<p>I have a theoretical question I'm hoping you can help me with.</p>

<p>Alright I have a home based server
300 down/30 up Internet (the best I can get where I am at).
I have a static IP and Permission from my IP to host my said server.</p>

<p>Alright everything's in place right? No, well maybe.</p>

<p>Being my server isn't top of the line I worry about 1 single thing,
let's say when I release my App (using my server as a back-end).</p>

<p>Let's say I have 20 thousand active users daily for 1 hour each per day, what's the likelihood of hundreds of people submitting posts (think of twitter posting, only text though) at one given time between 0-300 milliseconds. </p>

<p>What I mean is, think of MySQL, running queries, would 500 people posting text of 140 characters each drop a system to a crawl even with (in a perfect world - perfectly designed queries). And what would the likelihood be that 500 people submit at the same 0-300ms.. To me it doesn't seem very likely until you get into hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

<p>In other words, theory of time.
20K Active users Daily.
Likelihood of estimated theoretical queries per second IF they are all active at one given time. Lets say the average time per people posting ranges from 5-90 seconds. (Reading > Then posting).</p>

<p>I just don't see an issue, but something in the back of my head is making me over think this. The reason this came up is because my Web Hoster (Host-Gator) I found out had like 25 max connections to MySQL. Which freaked me out, and made me realize - what's the likelihood of 25 people at any given time on a small (20K active users on an app) reading that limit.</p>

<p>I haven't yet set any max connections on my server yet, I will eventually. (For obvious reasons). I just want to make sure I set it up to be optimally proficient, and in doing so, I need to at least articulate how many queries per second I can expect on average per so many people, E.G. 20K people.</p>

<p>To me 20K users isn't that many, but at the same time, I'm not very good at averaging things out in this kind of situation, because it's nothing but a big ('Unknown'), I mean how can I truly predict something like this without being in a live production environment. But being in a live production environment and having it smack be right back in the face and ruining my credibility to the end user is the worst that can happen.</p>

<p>Server Specs: (TO BE UPGRADED WHEN NEEDED).<br>
Windows 10<br>
8 Gigs of Ram.<br>
Intel Core I3<br>
Apache + PHP + MySQL (Not Xampp or Wamp), just each individual things set up.<br>
1 TB SSD<br>
Nothing else running on it - dedicated only for this sole purpose.</p>

<p>Yes I know, not very strong, but it's all I have and can afford at the moment.
There's no way in the world you'll catch me spending $174 a month for a decent dedicated server when i can save up a few months and just outright buy a new one later.</p>

<p>So this is just a temporary solution until I can afford something better.</p>
